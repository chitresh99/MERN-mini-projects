- **Simple To-Do List API**:
    - Create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API for managing to-do items.
    - Endpoints: `/todos` (GET, POST), `/todos/:id` (GET, PUT, DELETE).
    - Use an in-memory store or a JSON file for storing tasks.

newtask && newtask.trim(): This condition checks if newtask is not empty (newtask) and also ensures that after trimming whitespace (newtask.trim()), there is still a non-empty string.

expect the request body to also have a task property, as it aligns with the structure of the objects in your alltasks array.
