tracking refers to letter spacing, which is the amount of space between letters in text.

When you see something like tracking-wide, it means "increase the spacing between the letters slightly" to make the text easier to read or give it a certain style.

For example:

tracking-tight = reduce the space between letters.
tracking-wide = increase the space between letters.
tracking-normal = keep the default letter spacing.

gradient-to-r: Specifies the direction of the gradient, in this case, "to right".

add this before the word where you want space


max-w: Refers to the maximum width of an element. It sets an upper limit to how wide an element can grow.
